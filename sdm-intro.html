	<h3>Welcome!</h3>
	<div id="introtext">
		<p>Please read the following information carefully.</p>
		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>
		During the course of this experiment you will be shown a series of interactive images. The images show maps that depict the likelihood of road blockages in the event of a flood.
		</p>
		<h4>Activity</h4>
		<p>For each image, you are an emergency responder at location “A” with important supplies that have to be delivered to location “B” as fast as possible. You will be asked to choose/decide and draw a route (using your computer mouse).<br>
		<p>The route you select should be <b>as short as possible</b> whilst also having a <b>low likelihood</b> of being blocked.</p>
		<p>When you have drawn a complete route from A to B, you should then press on the “Submit” button to save your chosen route.  Once you have clicked on the “Submit” button, you cannot change your decision.
		</p>
		<h4>Time</h4>
		<p>In total you will be shown approximately 48 images and should expect the experiment to take approximately 30 &ndash; 35 minutes to complete.
		</p>
		<h4>Payment schedule</h4>
		<p>You will be paid a <b>base rate</b> of $7.00 for participating in the experiment. You can earn up to an additional $9.60 depending on the route you have drawn. When you have drawn a route when the road is not blocked you earn an additional experimental payment of $0.20. You will not earn any additional payment when the road is blocked. A summary of the payments is shown below.</p>

<h4>Questionnaire</h4>
<p>After completing the series of scenarios, you will be presented with a short questionnaire to complete. 
</p>
<p>The total accumulated amount you will be paid, including any additional payments, will appear on the screen after you have completed the questionnaire at the end of the experiment. 
</p>
<p>If at any point you do not wish to continue the experiment, please inform the experiment staff and you will be paid the base rate of $7.00.
</p>
<p>Thank you for your participation in this experiment.
</p>
<h4>Training Examples</h4>
<p>When you are ready please click the “Start training” button at the bottom of this page. You will be taken to an example scenario for pre-training before the experiment begins.

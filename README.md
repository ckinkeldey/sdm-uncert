## Spatial Decision Making Under Risk

Laboratory experiment with 60 student participants  
Joint work with Lisa Cheong, Matt Duckham (University of Melbourne, Australia)  
Publication currently under production  

This study was concerned with the influence of visualization on spatial decision making
(wayfinding). The participants of the study were confronted with a flooding scenario (“A
flooding event occurred in the area shown on the map. There is the risk that roads may be
blocked due to the flooding”) with different maps depicting flood likelihood with different
visualization techniques. The task was to select a route through the network with minimum
risk and length at the same time. After each selected route the user received feedback if the
road was blocked, based on the overall flood likelihood of the selected route. We measured success (number of routes not blocked) and the time needed, and additionally saved the
selected routes in the database. The analysis is still ongoing but preliminary results show
that the visualization techniques we used had different impact on spatial decision making of
the participants.

This repository contains the code for the interactive prototype used in the study. In a road network shown in the map the user chooses a road by selecting road elements. The prototype was created using the [d3.js library](http://d3js.org/, "d3.js library").
